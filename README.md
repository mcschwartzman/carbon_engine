# carbon_engine
Python-based POC of a simulation engine built to calculate the global carbon footprint's effect on the environment.

## To Run:

1. Install matplotlib and numpy. You can use a virtualenvironment if you don't care about plotting
2. Change the `test_year` to your desired year of analysis
3. Just run `python main.py` to get a 2nd-degree Least-squares-fit of your data and predict the sea-level at your test year
